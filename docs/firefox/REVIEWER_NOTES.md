This project uses Kotlin Multiplatform to transpile Kotlin to JS, so it uses Gradle as its build tool, and because of such, you'll probably need Java 17 installed to build this project.

Build instructions (how-to) are included in the 'COMMANDS.cd' file, just read it, set the TARGET_BROWSER environment variable to 'firefox', and run the single command in the 'Build' section to build an exact copy of the file I'm uploading here.

Furthermore, this project is fully open-source, and it's hosted here https://github.com/SecretX33/pjo-to-anki, where you can also find an automated pipeline using GitHub Actions for building this extension for any browser, which should facilitate any tests and checks.
